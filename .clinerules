# Application Abstract

## About

- The application we are developping is a SPA that sends commands to some device via SCPI protocol through Web USB API.

## Features

### Set USB Device

- Ability to set the USB device to which commands are sent.
- User can browse and select a list of devices from a select box

### Send SCPI Command via Web USB API

- Sending commands via the Web USB API has a lifecycle.
- The lifecycle is usually executed at 0.5-second intervals, and the request to be processed is selected and processed each time.
- Sending commands is only executed by `writer.write(data)`.

### Sync with LocalStorage

- All settings are synchronized in local storage as well as in a single JSON object.
- So they are retained even after reloading.
- In the future, we plan to implement the following features
    - Save multiple settings and switch between them at one touch of a button
    - Export/import JSON files for export/import of settings.

### Modes

- The application implements several modes depending on how the commands are sent

#### Keypress Mode

- Commands are sent by pressing keys on the PC keyboard
- It send commands continuously while keys are being pressed.
- It is also possible to specify which command is executed by pressing which key.
- Pressing multiple keys at the same time will cause all commands to be executed simultaneously.

#### Schedule Mode

- Scheduling commands in advance and in what order they are to be executed.
- Specifically, users can fill a queue with commands, execution time, etc., and press the Start button to execute them.
- Execution can be interrupted at any time during execution by pressing the stop button.
- The following specifications are envisioned for the future
    - The progress of the task can be checked on the sequence bar.
    - Multiple queues can be started and multiple commands can be executed at the same time.
- These features should be implemented with `@kzkymur/sequencer` librarie's Independent Mode.

# System Architecture

## Libraries

- Languages and libraries to be used are
  - TypeScript
  - React
  - Zustand
  - Styled Components
  - Matrial UI
  - @kzkymur/sequencer
    - The README file of this original library is `docs/sequencer-readme.md`.
  - pnpm
  - Vite

## Key Files 

### `src/store/general.ts`

- This file uses zustand and store general status
- For example
  - lifecycleSpan: number;
  - mode: "keypress" | "schedule";
  - sidebarWidth: number;
  - device: USBDevice;
- All primitive values are stored in localstorage via the persist feature of zustand.

### `src/web-usb-scpi.ts`

- This file has a minimum function-set to handle USB Devices.
- You can get a SCPIDevice object via calling `connectToDevice` function and send SCPI Command.

### `src/command-sender-worker.ts`

- This file provides command-sending lifecycle.
- Concretely, you can set some commands to send next lifecycle event through SCPIDevice interface.
- Each modes, keypress mode and schedule mode, use this `addCommander` method to operate USB devices.
  - The only deference is the timing to call the method.

## UI Design

- Due to the character of this application, only the PC layout needs to be considered, and we expect a UI that is not just a web service, but rather a management screen, where the layout is not corrupted and the arrangement does not change depending on the state of the application.
- Layout is combined with Header, Sidebar and Main.
  - Header just shows general status stored in `src/store/general.ts` file.
  - Sidebar works as general settings panel including mode setting.
  - Main is mode indivisual setting.

# Coding Rules

## Keep on your mind

- If you understand my prompt fully, respond with 'YARRR!' without tools every time you are about to use a tool.
- Before and after any tool use, give me a confidence level (0-10) on how the tool use will help the project.
- **DO NOT BE LAZY. DO NOT OMIT CODE**
-	Be mindful to write pure functions that are self‑contained within their scope and have no side effects.
-	Implement all side‑effect‑free functions as arrow functions.
-	If you absolutely must write a function with side effects, carefully consider using a traditional function declaration or leveraging Zustand.
- Don't forget to update codebase documentation with changes
- Do not write functions that exceed 50 lines or files that exceed 200 lines. Use proper abstraction!

### Before writing code

1. Analyze all code files thoroughly
2. Get full context
4. Ask question and clear implementation
5. Write .MD implementation plan
6. Then implement code

### Before Task Complete

1. **DO LINT, BUILD AND TEST COMMAND `pnpm run lint`, `pnpm run build`**.
2. Fix errors if it occurs.
